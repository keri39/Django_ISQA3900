# Django Assignment 1 (ISQA3900)

The project was published online using PythonAnywhere website. Below is the list of functionalities shown with the help of screenshots.

1)	Home Page:

The homepage has a navigation panel on the left side with four options. The main content has an introduction note and there is a section of dynamic content. This dynamic content shows the number of books, authors, copies, and available copies as we update the values in the admin site. At the bottom, it shows how many times we have visited the pages.

2)	All books panel:

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-09-15 at 6 36 28 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111935093/190878732-3c4feecc-d2d3-40ff-a428-5751cc5c1ff7.png">
<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-09-15 at 6 36 40 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111935093/190878778-048fabf1-a7cb-4bda-bd43-c67a10496d5c.png">

The screenshot above shows all the available books i.e., it is giving the list of the books. I have included pagination of 1 as I added only two books. So, the two books are divided into separate pages. This is to demonstrate that we could divide the pages as the number of books go up. The list contains the title and author of the book. The title of the book is clickable which gives us the book details.

3)	Book details:

Here, after clicking at the title of the book. We can see the book details. It contains author’s name (which is again clickable link giving author’s details), summary of the book, ISBN number, language, genre and number of copies.

4)	Author List:

Here, after clicking at ‘All authors’ from the side panel, we get the list of authors which are again clickable.

5)	Author Details:

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-09-15 at 6 37 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111935093/190878858-6f434a45-71fb-435f-b53f-924c5dd34f12.png">

After clicking at the author’s name, we are taken into another page with author’s details. It has the book name (which, when clicked gives us the book details), summary of the written book and genre.
